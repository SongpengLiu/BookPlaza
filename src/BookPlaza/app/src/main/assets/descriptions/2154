Told from the point-of-view of Dominic Butler, Sublimation is a short, intense glimpse of our favorite boys set deep in the timeline of Intimation, the next book in the Acclamation series by Vee Hoffman, due out in June."You ask me why I love him. I mean, anyone probably would. People want to know about things they don’t see every day, and that’s understandable enough. Everyone wants to know it from my perspective. To corner me looking all concerned, like it will finally allow me to tell some truth they think I’m hiding."Sublimation has been written as a companion story to the Acclamation series. We would therefore recommend checking out Acclamation and Reclamation novels for full story background.
