An impossible, forbidden love . . .Everyone told me I was making a mistake, but the heart wants what the heart wants, and my heart wanted Noah.We met and fell in love in the hidden fields and forests of Meadowview. If he was English or I was Amish, none of this would have happened. One of us had to make the sacrifice of leaving our culture to be together.
