An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found here.Sometimes love is right there for the taking. Responsible oldest of six brothers, Blake Coleman knows his desire for the sweet girl-next-door is wrong. While Jaxi has grown into a western-hat-wearing blonde with slim legs that go on forever, the responsible thing to do is keep his hands off. Jaxi has other plans for Blake's hands, and his heart. She's more than ready to convince him they’d be perfect together, but he can't seem to see past the big "don't touch" sign that's apparently hanging around her neck. When Jaxi ends up living on the Six Pack ranch right under Blake's nose, the undeniable heat between them slides off simmer and up to barn-burning levels. When a couple of Blake’s younger brothers decide Jaxi's brand of trouble is worth getting tangled up with, Blake's going to have to let go the reins and fight for what he really wants—her heart, forever.Warning: Unapologetically sexy, this book contains cowboys seducing and being seduced: in trucks, pool halls, and barns. Drool-worthy country charm, a little double-teaming, and a lot of secrets are revealed as the Coleman family saga begins. Saddle up and ride.Originally published 2009
