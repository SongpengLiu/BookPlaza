People think that Alex was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, not only rich, but blessed by luck. Men respect him, women dream of him, and Alex alone knows the strength it takes to conceal his tortured soul and devastating secrets.But despite those powerful life lessons, he has always believed in his father’s words, ‘When you fall in love, you love forever - it’s in our family blood. Look for HER and you’ll find your happiness beyond thought…’Valeria has never experienced actual romance (an early pregnancy, a hasty marriage, a life filled with work and study) and considers herself a pragmatist. She was taught to live by the rules: if you get married, then you love your husband; if you dream of a new home, then you work hard. But when, against all logic, she finds a beautiful stranger in her bed, her world turns upside down. After all, falling for the forbidden can be too sweet not to try… at least once.They come from the opposite ends of the globe, but the collision of two soulmates is destined. Fate will send them on a lifelong journey from Eastern Europe to Spain, France, the United States, and back.Their story is a mix of a beautiful fairy tale and a painful nightmare.

A passion that breaks all rules;

A hypnotic melody – it conquers all.

This is one love for life and beyond time,

This is MONOGAMY...
