 Jax and I are a constant. We're the blue of the sky. The cold of the ocean floor. I went to Europe to study. To party, to hide, to run away from the endless sea of choices that would mold and shape the rest of my life. I wasn't ready for any of that. Not yet. I wasn't ready to have all the answers. And I definitely wasn't ready for Jax.Handsome, sweet, and sporting the biggest blue eyes I'd ever seen, he swooped into my world and changed everything. Suddenly I wasn't scared of making choices. I wasn't afraid of voicing answers. It was easy because where Jax was concerned, my answer was always "Yes". But loving a military man isn't easy, and while Jax seemed like the answer to everything, he has questions of his own.Doubts about his future. Fears about his past.*Due to language and sexual situations this book is not recommended for readers under 18.
