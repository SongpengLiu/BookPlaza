If you could be positive that all hardships, pain, and difficulties you encountered would lead you and the ones you loved to boundless happiness…to what extent would you be willing to suffer? How much would you be willing to surrender? How much would you be willing to lose?My name is Scarlett Chamberlain. My answer is everything.Twenty-year-old Scarlett Chamberlain and her family are forced to live a life in hiding after her father is killed by the Kephale, the immortal council that governs Amaranthines.Scarlett and her family are only half Amaranthine and in the eyes of the Kephale, they are considered a disgrace to immortality and are in need of immediate eradication. Scarlett spends her days with her longtime best friend, Landon James. They’ve been in love for as long as they can remember but one thing stands in their way: Amaranthines receive a special imprint and their soul-mate bears the other half. Scarlett and Landon’s imprints do not match, therefore they are not meant to be.When a stranger enters Scarlett’s life, possessing the other half of her imprint, she is torn between following the rules of her kind and listening to her heart. However, none of that will matter when the Kephale comes knocking at her door.
