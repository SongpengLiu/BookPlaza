**Casey**I’m not looking for Mr. Right, not even Mr. Right Now. I have responsibilities that don’t leave room for a relationship. Still, a girl has needs. After moving to Canid and meeting the small town’s sheriff, I think he may just be the one to fulfill them. Ethan McKenzie is almost perfect. His one flaw? He wants to settle down. He’s determined to prove he’s the one for me, and when I stare into his chocolate eyes, I’m inclined to believe. However, the sheriff has secrets. Ones that could cost me my life.**Ethan**Being the alpha of a wolf pack isn’t easy. Not having a mate makes it even harder, especially with trouble brewing. The moment I caught a whiff of Casey Bryan’s scent, I knew she was mine. But she’s human. A purebred — alpha or not — mating with a human is unheard of. I not only have to convince her, but the entire pack, that she’s the one. My secret puts her in danger, but I will protect her with my life. I’ve waited too long for her. Nothing will keep me from her.**This is a standalone novel.**
