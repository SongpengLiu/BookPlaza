Everyone lured into Master Kalen's harem of humans is eager to play with their fairy captor or each other.And then there's Rhys, who has little interest in bedroom activities unless it involves ropes and knots. He's been told he can't love and that something must be wrong with him if he's uninterested in sex.Surely, a fairy who owns a harem would never understand such a thing even though he's willing to play on Rhys's terms. If Rhys is going to be trapped in a pocket realm for forty years, he might as well enjoy what he's allowed.It's not like he has to marry the fairy with icy eyes and silvery hair.This asexual M/M romance contains plenty of rope, forced marriage, a Norse trickster God, and a fairy who might understand Rhys after all. Mpreg exists in the fairy realm, but this book does not end with a pregnancy or a baby.
