Body Contact is the second of a three-part erotic series from New York Times and USA best-selling author Cathryn Fox.Asking pro football player Jack Rider to teach me everything he knows about sex might have seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I'm not so sure I can handle a guy like him. I thought he'd just straight up do me, ridding me of my pesky virginity sooner rather than later. But no, he had his own ideas about bringing me up to speed on sex. His two weeks of slow seduction might just be the death of me, but since he's the one in charge, I have to play the game his way. Not that I'm not enjoying it. I am. Who wouldn't, right? I guess I just can't help but wonder how I'll ever let another man touch me after him.This is the second of a three-part series full of mind-blowing sex, featuring a dirty-mouthed football player who knows the score and an inexperienced therapist who needs to learn it. BODY CONTACT is sure to leave readers begging for more. The next installment comes September 2016.
