Ezra Lucas is not an easy person to love. At least, that's what she's always been told.She's too cold, too independent, too much of a know-it-all, too much of a Medusa. That last one is still a little unclear. A blind date once told her to burn in the seven fiery pits of Hell.But one day Ezra comes home to find her maternal grandfather dead on the bathroom floor wearing only a towel that—thankfully—covers his waist. The seconds it took to roll over his lifeless body will be ingrained in her memory forever. That’s around the time she decides she’s had enough of pain and misery. She finds herself back in Montreal with her paternal grandfather, Walter “Cowboy” Brown, a take-no-shit army vet who has a big mouth, the only other person who knows the depth of this loss.It's at a celebration of life where she runs into Tobias Flynn. He was the boy next door, the one who snuck through her bedroom window and reassured her she'd make it through the night. But now he’s a grumpy—and hateful and spiteful and sexy —man straight out of the romance novels Ezra’s obsessed with. A lot has changed in the last ten years, but one thing hasn't.Tobias Flynn has always been effortlessly in love with Ezra Lucas.
