Working at Rolling Thunder Motorcycles has been enough for Ryder, until now. He's always been the shy, quiet one. He watched his father find love and didn't think it was possible for him. Until he met Molly. Something stirred inside of him, but would he take the leap out of his shell to ask her out? Molly has always been head strong and devoted to her work. Building up her photography business has always been top priority. Vowing to not make the same mistakes as her mother, she put love on the back burner. That is until she is hired to shoot a wedding and the groom’s son catches her off guard. Is Molly ready to take that leap and realize not all men are the same? Will Ryder and Molly be able to move past their own insecurities and calm the storm that rages inside them? Or will they be Rydin’ the Storm Out alone?
