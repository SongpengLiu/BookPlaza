Matilda Goodnight and Davy Dempsy are both trying to get the upper hand with the gorgeous gold-digging Clea Lewis, but they will forge a temporary if reluctant alliance to take on an inept art collector, a disgruntled heir, an exasperated hitmat, and a seductive femme fatale as they deal with false identities, forged paintings, swindles, and love. 100,000 first printing.
