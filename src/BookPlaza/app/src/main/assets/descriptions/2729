Ema Marx is in a race against time. Or rather, a race against Apollyon. A powerful weapon—the legendary philosopher’s stone—could tip the scale in favor of whoever gets their fangs on it first. For Ema, obtaining the stone is an uphill battle through love, alliance, heartbreak, and loyalty. Winning should mean the beginning of beautiful things, but the closer Ema gets to her destiny, the more uncertain her future becomes. Could it be this war was never meant for her? And why the heck doesn’t morning sickness adhere to rules of its own name?This is the third book in the Ema Marx series by J.D. Brown. The other books in the series are:Athena's Oracle (Book 0.5)Dark Heirloom (Book 1)Dark Liaison (Book 2)Dark Becoming (Book 3)
