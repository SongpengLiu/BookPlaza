A College Romance...For years, I’ve dreamt of what college life could bring and while some things changed, there was always one constant. It didn’t matter how wild I allowed my imagination to run, it always led me to the same place in the end. It led me to him. My future was clear, and he was it. Until suddenly ... he wasn’t. Now I’m a shell of who I was, on a path too blurry to follow, and I see no way out.No way up. They say first loves last forever.That’s exactly what I’m afraid of.
