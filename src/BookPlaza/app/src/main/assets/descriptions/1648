Lily’s back on her home turf in London for Christmas, after a turbulent term, studying music in Miami. She wonders if her relationship with Will can survive their stupidity and what this means for their music collaboration. Lily realises all too late, that she’s fallen hard for Alfie despite his declaration to her that he can’t love her. This has left Lily devastated, knowing that the man she loves will never feel the same for her. Meanwhile, Alfie has continued his relentless pursuit of Lily to take what he wants from her, testing her resolve not to continue their relationship. She had found the strength to resist all of his advances, until the night before she flew home. After giving herself one last night with him, she fled across the Atlantic, thinking time and distance with family and friends would help heal her broken heart. What Lily never expected, was for her traumatic love life to follow her, both to London and Miami through the chapters of her life, during the following year. Her music career and studies improve tremendously though, fuelling her performance and personal identity, but her love life is as complex as ever. Alfie makes some disclosures which could be game changers for the both of them, and asks for her trust and time. Lily wonders if she should trust him, asking herself if Alfie could ever be, everything she needs?
