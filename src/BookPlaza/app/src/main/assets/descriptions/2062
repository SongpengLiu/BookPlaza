Three years after their breakup, Danielle and Joe are forced to deal with each other again during a weekend reunion of their group of friends. This comes at a time when Joe is convinced all he needs is time and peace to recover from the crazy relationship he just walked out of, and heading back to the town he grew up, see friends and his sister Sarah seems like just the right thing.

Now that he’s in town, staying with his sister Sarah, who happens to be Danielle’s best friend, avoiding him is impossible. Especially with the reunion weekend coming up. It doesn’t take long until an emotional roller coaster ride begins, during which Joe and D try to come to terms with the way they still feel about each other. If it was only possible to figure things out without Sarah getting wind of it… CAN YOU MEND IT? Is not only about the sometimes comical complexity of getting back together after a breakup, but also about the multi-layered relationship between siblings and the meaning of friendship.
