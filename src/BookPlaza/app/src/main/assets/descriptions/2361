From USA Today bestselling author Parker S. Huntington comes an enemies-to-lovers, slow-burn romance full of revenge and a dash of fate.  “She could enjoy her pretty, perfect world a little longer. Soon enough, everything she owned would be mine.”  I had a plan to escape the friend zone. Step one: sneak into Reed’s room. Step two: sleep with him.  But when the lights turned on, it wasn’t familiar blue eyes I saw. These were dark, angry, and full of demons. And they belonged to Reed’s much older brother.  Four years later, Nash Prescott is no longer the help’s angry son. I’m no longer the town’s prized princess.  At twenty-two, I’m broke, in need of a job. At thirty-two, he’s a billionaire, in need of revenge.  Who cares if my family ruined his? Who cares if he looks at me with pure loathing? Who cares if every task he assigns me is designed to torture?  I need the money. Simple as that.  I’ll suffer his cruelty in silence, knowing there’s one thing he wants more than revenge… Me.  Note: Devious Lies is a 145,000-word standalone in the Cruel Crown series. If you love banter and angst, this book is for you! Welcome to Eastridge. Enter if you dare.
