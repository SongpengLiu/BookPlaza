"What's Mr. Perfect look like?" "Tall, dark and handsome," she joked knowing that the description was what most women were attracted to. "So you want someone like James," he said. "What?!" she asked immediately turning to look at him. "No," she said. Silently looking out the truck window for a few seconds she wondered why her grandpa would bring up his name. "No, why would you say that?" she asked turning back to look at him. "Well, you described him." Her grandpa thought that her reaction when he brought up James's name was quite funny. "I've never thought about him that way," she said checking her makeup in the visor mirror. Folding the visor back up she wondered if her grandpa was wanting to talk boys in general or if he was wanting to talk about James Hawkins. "Why not? He's a good man," her grandpa said pointing out the obvious. "He's Chase's friend. He's off limits. No matter how good of a man, or how cute or smart or sweet...," her voice began to drift off. Shaking her head, she realized that she could have kept going, but this conversation was now over. Narrowing her eyes she briefly looked at her grandpa. She had just voluntarily said more about James than she had ever told anyone. "James is off limits," she sternly said out loud.
