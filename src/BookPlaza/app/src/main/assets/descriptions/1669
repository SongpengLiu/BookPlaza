The epic conclusion to the Shadow Beast Shifters.I finally have the life I always dreamed of. So why does it taste like ash on my tongue?Growing up in Torma, the strongest of the shifter packs, I wanted nothing more than to find my true mate and live my best life. Of course, that dream existed before my father betrayed the pack and turned me into their punching bag.I’d all but given up, until a quirk of true mate genetics gifted me a true mate like no other.It seems my childhood dreams were finally a reality. Funny how quickly dreams turn into nightmares.I’m being lied to and missing weeks and months of time. Someone messed with me and no matter how often I’m told to forget it and move on as Torin’s mate, there’s no way I can. Whoever did this to me should have known I’d pick at it until it bled. It’s my nature after all.As I search out random growls, flutters in my chest, and a suspicion that there’s so much more going on than I could even imagine, I sense that I’m racing against an unknown clock.I need to get to the bottom of this mystery.And when I figure out who stole my memories, they’re going to wish they never messed with Mera Callahan.Game on.*If you like sexy, dark paranormal romances, with humor, steam, action, a tough heroine and an antihero, this is for you.Reborn is full length (115k) words, and is the final in the Shadow Beast Shifters series, and does NOT end on a cliffhanger.
