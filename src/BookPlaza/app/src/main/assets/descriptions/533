I thought I had years before I'd have to ascend to the Seelie throne, but all that went out the window when my Uncle Rowan decided to abdicate early. Ugh, I don't wanna! I mean I know I have no choice, but can't a girl have a little fun before she has to spend the rest of her life with a stick up her ass? Not to mention I'm a nymph and I haven't even lost my v-card yet. Yeah, a trip to Earth is a must. I'll have a little loose fun if ya know what I mean, and then I'll come back. I swear.When Ell finds out she has one year before she'll have no choice but to ascend, she decides a little trip to Earth is in order. She finds herself working in a bar in a tiny little town in Texas where she meets Mr. Hottie McHotterson himself. Unfortunately, her sexcapade vaca goes sideways when she gets a new boss, and finds out the UnSeelie are plotting to kill her uncle.A Fairy Awesome Story is a medium-burn RH. Ell collects men as she goes!
