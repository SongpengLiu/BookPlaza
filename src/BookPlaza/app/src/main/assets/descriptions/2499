If you were thinking about giving Spellbound a try, I recommend reading it first.--THE GUILD CODEXDemonized Series:Taming Demons for Beginners (#1)Slaying Monsters for the Feeble (#2)Hunting Fiends for the Ill-Equipped (#3)Spellbound Series:Three Mages and a Margarita (#1)Dark Arts and a Daiquiri (#2)Two Witches and a Whiskey (#3)Demon Magic and a Martini (#4)The Alchemist and an Amaretto (#5)Druid Vices and a Vodka (#6)
