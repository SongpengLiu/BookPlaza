Jonathan Ashcroft--aka Sade--never asked for kindness or second chances, but he gets both when Mercy the mysterious do-gooder shows up in his life out of nowhere.First order of business is--where the hell did she even come from? Who is she, really? How does she know about his sadistic affairs, but more importantly, what is she suddenly doing in them?Yes, he's asked her all these questions five different ways. Nicely. And even while tied to a chair in a compromising position, she still refuses to cooperate. Continues to lie. Play stupid. He can only assume she wants him to force the issue even more than this. Sweet Miss Mercy wants to stick her nose where it doesn't belong? She wants help him, no strings attached? Fine. He'll play her cute game. But that will come with a price. Terms and conditions. Contracts. And they will especially include satisfying his sadistic needs. Let's see how helpful she's feeling then.
