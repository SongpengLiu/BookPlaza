The final installment to the Cat and Mouse Duet...The DiamondDeath walks alongside me,But the reaper is no match for me.I'm trapped in a world full of monsters dressed as men, and those who aren't as they seem.They won't keep me forever.I no longer recognize the person I've become,And I'm fighting to find my way back to the beast who hunts me in the night.They call me a diamond,But they've only created an angel of death.The HunterI was born a predator,With ruthlessness ingrained in my bones.When what's mine is stolen from me in the night,Like a diamond hidden within a fortress,I find that I can no longer contain the beast.Blood will paint the ground as I tear apart this world to find her.And bring her back to where she belongs.No one will escape my wrath,Especially not those who have betrayed me.Warning: This is the second and final installment to the Duet. You must read Haunting Adeline first.
