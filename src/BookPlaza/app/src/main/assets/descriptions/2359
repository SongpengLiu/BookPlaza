The kingdom isn’t supposed to fall.  The truth screws you over before it sets you free. Masks drop. Secrets unravel. Elsa’s race after the past blinds her from the present. I’ll fight for her. I’ll bring her back. I’ll protect her even if it’s the last thing I do. We made a promise. She’s mine. Are you ready for one final game, sweetheart?   Twisted Kingdom is book three of Royal Elite Series and should be read after Deviant King & Steel Princess. This is a dark high school bully romance, mature new adult, and contains dubious situations that some readers might find offensive.  This book is the final part of a trilogy and is NOT standalone.
