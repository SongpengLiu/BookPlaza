Some men like Prince Leon Stark are born to fight.Leon has always had a way of remembering slights and anything done to him from a young age. Nothing feels better than getting back at someone that deserves it even if it takes time and patience. After a brutal hold war, he earns the nickname Leon the Lion and returns home to find that his older brother, Stefan, has committed an unforgivable act of betrayal amongst brothers. Their simmering dislike turns to hate, and Leon waits for the chance to get back at him and the woman he foolishly gave his heart to. Stefan soon learns that revenge doesn’t always require a blade. When Leon enters another hold war, he gains new enemies, including one named Previl. Leon would rather face his opponents directly in combat, but not everybody shares that same value. Can he survive the treachery of Previl and his side? Will he reach a new height of cruelty? The arrogant Prince never had a soft heart to begin with, and there are fates worse than a sword thrust. It never pays to mess with the Lion. This is Jack's Reign side novel, and takes place before Jack's Day. It can be read as a standalone, but if you're reading the series, I suggest reading it after Chloe's Purpose.
