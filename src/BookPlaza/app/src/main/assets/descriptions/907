Born with low vision, Blake has grown up preferring routines and disliking changes. Keeping everything the same is safer and helps him keep his independence. A visit to Grandma’s house shakes his world. Werewolves, fairies, and gods like Loki are all real, but he doesn’t want anything to do with them, and he certainly doesn’t want to bond with a werewolf. Can Blake learn to accept changes and grow with them, or will he lose his chance at true love and possibly his life?This M/M monster fairy tale contains explicit material including light bondage, rimming, knotting, and anal sex. Reader discretion is advised. This contains the Loki from the novella, Loki’s Price, which is not required to understand Little Red Riding Hood.
