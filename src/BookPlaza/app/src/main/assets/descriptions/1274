When Tippy the Knight was first written in the early 13th century, the Gramoan Continent wasn’t ready for erotic stories in this period. The author’s tales managed to survive to the present day but were mostly forgotten. Her characters and world were stolen, sanitized, and made into a series of children’s books about a bumbling, clumsy Knight.This is the real Tippy that was intended to be read about. He lives in a world of shifters, dragons, magic, war, and dark delights.When Etinne is locked up in a tower, she expects her husband, Tippy, to come for her. He’ll do it, but maybe not for the reason she thinks. Anyone who threatens his first, true love will face suffering and death.This is a male dragon shifter/human pairing with a HEA. It contains dark, explicit material and is only intended for mature readers.
