Nicole Lander has no choice but to contact Ryan Titan, the boy she had loved beyond compare when she was a teenager. Her sister was in desperate need of a heart operation, or she would not live more than six months. Nicole had lied to Ryan when they were teen's because she had not wanted him to find out about the abuse she was going through from her father. When Ryan Titan gets the call from Nicole, needing his help, he is ecstatic. He would finally get to exact his revenge for her dumping him for not being good enough for her. He will help out her sister, but she will pay him back every night until he is done with her. The problem is that he has never felt about any other woman the way he feels about Nicole, and his revenge is turning into him wanting to walk her down the aisle.
