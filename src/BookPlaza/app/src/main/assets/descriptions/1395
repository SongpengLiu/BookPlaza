Having experienced hate and violence at a young age for being a homosexual, Finley has been cautious in the years since. When he meets Travis, the son of the Earl of Loughton, he learns that some families don’t despise their homosexual children. The Earl and his wife still love Travis and are willing to keep his secret. They need a guard for their daughter, Bella, and Finley takes the job.  It seems like the perfect situation since Finley gains a friend in her and a lover in Travis. Higher ups can often get away with more, so as long as the two men aren’t open about their relationship, they can stay together. Once Bella doesn’t need a guard anymore, Finley could be the Master Steward and remain with his lover who seems great.  The problems start small and build. Boundaries are ignored, accusations are made, and Finley’s shut out if he tries to stand up for himself. Travis says he loves him and has never felt this way about anyone before. Issues in the family are weighing on him, but things will get better, right?  When it escalates into violence, Finley knows he needs to get away, but Travis doesn’t allow lovers to leave unless he decides he’s done first. He’ll go to great lengths to hunt them down and punish them. Betrayed by everyone he thought he could count on, Finley’s options start running out. He’s used to being abandoned, but sometimes, help can come from the most unexpected people and in the strangest circumstances.
