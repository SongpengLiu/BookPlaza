We’re flawed. Both full of scars and tormented by the shadows of our past. But in each other’s arms we find solace, we find perfection.
  Adam Black. Gorgeous, demanding, a sinful dream that once was my reality.  I was his… until I walked away.  For months I’ve managed to curb my Adam addiction. I’ve focused my energy on my painting career. I’ve found success. Still there is a dangerous urge within me I can’t resist, one that tempts me to be reckless. My life isn’t complete.  Something is missing… he’s missing.  I left him, but fate again has made us collide. And this time I won’t turn away—I won’t be the only one revealing the scars of my past.  I was his… am his… and this time he’ll be completely mine.
