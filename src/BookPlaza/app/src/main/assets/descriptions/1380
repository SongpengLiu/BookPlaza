But never one to back away from a challenge, she’s drawn to him even while she continues to satisfy her physical needs elsewhere. Even as she spends her evenings in another man’s arms, she somehow finds herself curled up in Cohen’s bed each night. It’s been a long time since she had a true honest-to-goodness make out session, but Cohen’s showing her just how much fun not having sex can be.When Cohen’s injured, her real feelings for him rise to the surface, and she has to decide if she’s willing to take a risk on love after enduring so much heartbreak in her past. MAKE ME YOURS is the sexy conclusion to UNRAVEL ME. Ashlyn and “Logan” from UNRAVEL ME also make a few, um *appearances* …ahem.
