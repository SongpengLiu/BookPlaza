The Land of the Fae is strong with all four courts banded as one, but uncertainty still remains as they all work together to end the dark sorcerer’s evil reign. Sorcha—the one and only Winter Court princess—has a secret, a secret that she has enjoyed keeping for the past six months. When a much awaited announcement brings her to the Spring Court, and face to face with the man in her dreams, will she be strong enough to keep up the façade of her icy exterior, or will she melt into his arms like she does in her dreams?After formally meeting Sorcha at the Winter Ball, Drake—Summer Court prince and army leader—knew there was a fiery passion underneath her winter skin, a passion he wanted desperately to ignite with his own. However, with her frigid responses toward him he’s decided to keep his distance, except how can he when his dreams feel real? Seeing her again only ignites his interest, and this time he’s not going to let his arrogance or her frosty heart stand in his way.Through unexpected tragedy, Sorcha discovers the one thing the dark sorcerer has spent his whole existence trying to protect, but what makes it more difficult is that only one of the Four is strong enough to retrieve it. The tides have now changed. With Drake’s help, will Sorcha find what she’s searching for? Or will the dark sorcerer beat them to it, shattering all hope of finding out the one thing that could save the Land of the Fae … how to destroy him?
