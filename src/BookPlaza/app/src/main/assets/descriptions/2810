I thought my life was over, and then I met her . . . and wouldn’t you know it, she’s a hooker. I figure it’s fate paying me back for every bad thing I’ve ever done, because a prostitute has to be the most inappropriate match a man in my position can make. Still, I can’t stay away.One taste and Cate had a grip on me like some illicit drug. I know it’s bad, but it feels so good. She’s a hallucinogenic. She makes me believe it doesn’t matter who she is, what she is, as long as she’s mine, and I know I won’t be able to rest until she is. Mine.Author's Note: He's a billionaire. She's a hooker. You know the story, but this time it's told from HIS point of view. If you like Before Cate, check out Cat Haus, Cate's story.
