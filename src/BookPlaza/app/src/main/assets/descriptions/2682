New Release!THIRD EDITION of Romantic Suspense REVERB50+ pages, and a lot more story added.Why?James' full story is worth telling...https://www.amazon.com/Reverb-J-Cafes...Also available in print.---James Whren is brilliant, beautiful, rich, and takenâ€”with himself, or more precisely, his genius for creating music. Desired by many, committed to no one but his muse, on the eve of his brother's funeral, his father inadvertently turns his life into a living nightmare, and James is left abandoned in hell with no one real to save him. Until Elisabeth, and her son, Cameron. Reverb is a love story, a psychological thriller paced with romantic suspense. Told in a new "clipped" style, Reverb reads fast. Immediate. "Intense," like a sting of texts for today's reader. Spun from The Magus, also about a man who learns to love someone other than himself, Reverb is like nothing you've read, guaranteed.
