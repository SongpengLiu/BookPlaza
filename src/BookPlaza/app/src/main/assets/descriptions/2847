Unbroken is the fourth and final book in the "UNDEFEATED" series. This book follows the lives of Shane and Kace from book One - UNDEFEATED, and is the follow up to book one. As Shane Dekkar prepares for the biggest fight of his career - the Heavyweight Championship of the World - life throws him an unexpected uppercut so damaging he takes a step back and reconsiders EVERYTHING. In his reevaluation of life and all things in it, he migrates to where he found comfort for years, street fights and bare knuckles matches for spare cash. Risking his career, health, the championship, his relationship, and his friends, Shane must find a way to rise from the muck and mire he's living in and either fight for what he believes in, or remain where he currently finds comfort - in the bowels of society. Can people truly change or do we always naturally migrate to a place of comfort in hard times? Will Shane go back to his love, friends, and life, or will he revert to his roots and be a loner? Best described in A-Train's discussion with Ripp, Shane just might be "Unbroken"... "I've seen what exposing a man to violence and bloodshed can do, Ripp. I've witnessed it first hand. Some men take exception to it from the start, and those men can recover. The savages? The men who came from a life of violence? Well, they actually find comfort in it. There isn't a way to fix 'em, because they aren't really broken. Lemme ask you a question. If you take a wolf out of the wild, does it take the wild out of the wolf?" Unbroken, the final chapter in the Undefeated series. *WARNING* This book contains scenes of graphic violence and sex that some readers may find offensive.
