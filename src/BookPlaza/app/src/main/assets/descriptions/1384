Life's been many things for twenty year old Bryn Dawson, but one thing it's never been is easy. And it's only about to get harder.As the gossip of Bryn being Betrothed to her true love's little brother, Patrick, becomes more reality than rumor, Bryn does her best to think positive thoughts, ignore Patrick's odd behavior, avoid Paul's relentless advances, and attempts to conjure William back from his latest overseas mission. She fails on all fronts. The night an army of Inheritors set out with an agenda to deliver vengeance on any Guardian surrounding Bryn, the Betrothal Ball becomes the least of her worries. Instead of worrying about who she'll be marching down the aisle towards, she has to accept she might not be making the journey down the aisle ever.
