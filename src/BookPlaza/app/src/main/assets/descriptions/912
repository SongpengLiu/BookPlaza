Book two in the Mitchell Series starts where Letting Go left off.Ty and Miranda have always considered themselves cousins, due to the fact that they both share a common relative - Colt - even though they aren't really related at all. After helping Miranda deliver her baby in the backseat of a car, Ty becomes closer to both she and her baby. Their long distance friendship keeps them platonic, even though in the past they both have wondered if there was something more happening between them. When something happens and Miranda is forced to leave Kentucky and stay at Ty's parents farm, sparks start to fly. Can bad boy Ty change his ways in order to be with the one person that knows him better than anyone?
