When asked to be the keynote speaker to honor my stepfather’s twenty-fifth year with Ridenhour Racing, I was determined to get even with my stepbrothers. When I took an instant dislike to the team's young superstar, Dale knocked my plans awry by betting his prized '71 Barracuda Hemi against Kolby’s new Audi RS7 that I could beat the rising NASCAR superstar in a drag race. I agree to the high-stakes bet, only to realize I’m back where I swore to never be again, drag racing on the country lane where Colt Hannah ruined my life. Can I find a way to put Colt and Caine on their knees and still win the race, or must I betray the growing relationship I’ve found with my stepfather to get vengeance on the pair who humiliated me? One thing hasn’t changed in the four years since I left town. Nothing with the Hannah brothers is ever what it seems. And once more, when I leave town again, neither am I.
