I may have lit the match the first time, but I won’t be the one left burned this round. The elites run this town, but they aren’t ready for a girl like me. Especially the boys who’ve made it known from the beginning I’m not wanted here the one summer I stayed with my father. I don’t belong—I know that—but now I’m coming back. Forced into the one place I despise after my addict mother unexpectedly dies. Four months before my eighteenth birthday. The worst of them all is my half-brother’s best friend. The leader of the group. My enemy. Those hate fueled-cerulean eyes still haunt me in my dreams. He thinks he can break me, but what he doesn’t know is I’ve already been shattered. I hope they’re ready because I’m not the obedient, delicate person they remember. It’s my turn to watch them simmer. Welcome to the world of the hellhounds. You’ll hate it here. SHATTERED PRINCESS is a full-length new adult high school enemies-to-lovers novel. It is the first book in the Hardin Hellhounds Series and does end in a cliffhanger.
