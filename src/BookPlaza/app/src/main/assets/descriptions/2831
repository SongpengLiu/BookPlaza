Rapid Eye Movement.When Jennifer Scott and Lucy Wilson were injured in accidents near their respective homes in Cyprus and England, they had no inkling of the connection that was formed when their consciousnesses collided and linked them together within their dreams.Both are ordinary women. Living their lives. They have never met. Yet when Jennifer goes to sleep each night, she finds herself dreaming how Lucy came to be the woman she is today. She learns of the dream house Lucy found in the Yorkshire Dales, the two daughters she adores and her happy, but ordinary, life with her husband, Charlie. When Lucy’s head hits the pillow, she is immediately transported to Jennifer’s world in Cyprus. There she learns how Jennifer met Ilan - the love of her life – and she experiences the loneliness and worry this relationship causes Jennifer. Why is each woman dreaming the other’s life? Is it real? What does it mean? More importantly, if one of them stops dreaming what will happen to the other?
