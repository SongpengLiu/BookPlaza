When they find out Tab may be one of those fairies, they attempt a pretty epic rescue. Only, in true Ell fashion, things don't go according to plan. When things are looking bleak, a Mer shows up to save the day, or something close to it. That wink, though.ASAF is a medium-burn reverse-harem series where Ell collect men/fairies as the series progresses.WARNING: Contains language, and graphic adult situations.
