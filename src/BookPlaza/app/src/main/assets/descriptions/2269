I'm not so different from most people. Like everyone else, I have life goals.  Goal #1: Become a real girl instead of this invisible ghost thing I currently am.  Goal #2: Convince the four men I've been haunting for the past five years to pick me to be their new toy after goal one is complete.  Goal #3: Figure out who/what I am and why I can't remember anything past the five years I've been haunting this quad.  Goal #4: Eat popcorn.  See? Perfectly normal. Sort of. Gotta start small, after all. It's not like anyone else is perfect either.  **Sexual situations **Reverse Harem **Dark humor galore **Language warning
