Yet, unlike other humans, Violet has not given up on hope - she knows that somewhere across the stars roams a man who can reverse the course of fate - the Young Captain of the Galaxy Pirates.Violet dreams to find this legendary man and enter his crew of audacious pirates fighting against the cruel world, in the hope of getting their help to save her planet and people.
