HE'S A BILLIONAIRE. SHE'S A HOOKER...Working in a cathouse always was interesting, but especially after he walked through the door. Then, everything changed... I'm Cate. Two years ago I was an English major at UNLV. Today, I'm a legal prostitute in Nevada and I was happy with that, and then John arrived. He's a billionaire. I'm a hooker. Now, things are far from simple and I'm wresting with how to mix business with pleasure. How is that going to work? You can read that for yourself. Cat Haus is our story.*Note: This is a compilation of the individual titles Cat Haus, Cat Haus 2 and Cat Haus 3. They have been joined into one full-length novel for those readers who requested it.
