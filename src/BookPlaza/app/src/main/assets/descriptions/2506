Tessa Ross tries to fight her attraction to bad boy Lucas Links. He is hot, arrogant, and has a sexual past that most boys his age could only dream of, (If they even knew they could dream of such things). Lucas, the star quarterback seems to have it all, super star athletic abilities, expensive clothes, cars, and women who literally stop just to watch him walk by. On the outside he appears to have it all. Tessa is a young woman who lives her life always doing what is right to make everyone else happy. She tries desperately to hold herself accountable to the demanding expectations of her family and everyone around her. Is Tessa as innocent as she appears? Is Lucas just a spoiled young man who seems to have what every male, and female wants?A troubled home life exposed. Past flings fight for his attention. While the only girl who Lucas ever dated connives to win him back using the only thing she knew held him to begin with. Does her desperation destroy a love he never knew existed before Tessa? A love bound not by his past or hidden secrets. A love of truth and depth. A love that knew no end regardless of tragic circumstance. Blue Love is not your typical love story. It is a journey through your past or a story of one close to you. Itâ€™s our story.
