One beauty. Two beasts. The one who owns her. And the one who wants her. *** I was sixteen when I made the deal. When I put my fate in the hands of Shayne McAllister, a man determined to break me. A man with black eyes and a blacker heart, who’s been obsessed with me since we were kids. And now that my father has passed, he’s coming to collect his debt. But before I become his, I see a chance to make a choice for myself, and I take it. I slip away, for one night. One dark, stormy night that goes horribly wrong. Until a stranger crosses my path. An angry stranger, with a harsh voice and menacing eyes, who grants me one night. One messed up, beautiful night, that changes everything, and spares no one. Because the stranger wants more. More than just one night. He wants me. What follows, is darkness. A darkness where secrets will be revealed, blood will be shed, and sacrifices made. My name is Ava, and this is my story.  (This is a very DARK, contemporary romance/erotic thriller with scenes some will find disturbing. It is a story about love and obsession, about hope and despair, but most of all, it is about finding light through the darkness. For mature audiences only.)  ***This is Book One of the BEAUTY & THE DARKNESS Trilogy***
