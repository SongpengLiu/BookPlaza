“The first time I laid eyes upon her, I was instantly mesmerized by her softness, her beauty. I knew at once that I was done for… Never would I want another woman.” Vincenzo was reasonably happy with his life. He had a stylish place to live and a job most other men would die for— having sex with multiple partners every night and servicing wealthy clients in the VIP, male and female alike. For years now, he had been one of the star performers at Sanguelascivia, a swanky erotic nightclub in Venice for the Vampire elite.But then Giuliana wandered in to the club, a destitute young widow who had nowhere else to turn. She was nothing like the other women there at Sanguelascivia. Sure, many of them were gorgeous and naturally, he enjoyed fucking them, but none of them ever interested him in the least. Perhaps it was merely because Giuliana was not yet hardened by this lifestyle. She was beautiful in a soft and compassionate kind of way that he had not known in a long time. Never had Vincenzo seen anyone quite like her.And now, he could not seem to get her out of his mind. Nor did he want to.Vincenzo begins fantasizing about Giuliana during his every performance with the other women. Then he must agonizingly witness her initiation performance with two men. Will he be able to stand it, or will his emotion get the better of him? Will they ever be scheduled to perform together so that he may know the pleasure of being with her? It is as if someone is determined to keep them apart…But then something happens which forces Vincenzo to act quick, altering the course of both of their fates forever. He has to make the most difficult choice of his life— fleeing Sanguelascivia, and the woman he loves.Will he ever see Giuliana again or will he go through eternity longing for the one woman who has ever touched his heart?
