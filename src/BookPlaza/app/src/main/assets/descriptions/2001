 Ever since he won an Academy Award for best original screenplay, Grant McCarthy's personal and professional lives have fallen apart. Worst of all, Abby, the woman he was supposed to marry, is engaged to someone else. And with his father recovering from a serious injury, Grant is back at home on Gansett Island helping run the family marina. He should be focused on winning back the love of his life, but he's got a new distraction to deal with . . .Exasperating, annoyingly sexy Stephanie, who runs the marina restaurant, is working her way under Grant's skin--and into his bed. And as a major tropical storm cuts off Gansett Island--and the two of them--from the mainland, Grant begins to suspect Stephanie is hiding something big from her past. When he finds out what it is, what will be more important to him? Winning Abby back or helping Stephanie to right a terrible wrong--and maybe even getting his own life back on track in the process?
