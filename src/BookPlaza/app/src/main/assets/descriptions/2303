I was abducted by aliens. The aliens that I've been auctioned to don’t speak my language, and I definitely can’t speak theirs. I didn’t expect to get married by accident to the sweet one. I didn’t expect to have a grumpy alien bond to me, and go a little crazy if other males get near me, or if I try to leave. It doesn’t matter if they’ve won my heart. I can’t stay. Somehow, I have to explain that I NEED to go home. Because the bad aliens that abducted me? They took me from my babies.  **Note: For those of you that prefer not to be surprised, there are TWO heroes in this story. It is a Happily Ever After with three people, a mini Reverse Harem set up of MFM (male/female/male) that doesn't quite classify as Menage... and you'll find out why. ♥ For those of you who DO prefer to be surprised… pretend you didn’t read this warning! ;)  This is Tara's story. It technically *can* be read as a stand-alone, however, previous books in the series set up events in this book.
