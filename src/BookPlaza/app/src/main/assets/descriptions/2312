ORPHEUS — To most he’s an enigma, a devil-may-care rogue who does whatever he pleases whenever he wants. Now this loose cannon is part of the Eternal Guardians­—elite warriors assigned to protect the human realm—whether he likes it or not.Orpheus has but one goal: to locate a magical medallion with supernatural powers. He’s just not expecting a woman to get in the way, especially not a Siren as gorgeous as Skyla. Unable to resist her, the two become unlikely allies. He simply has no idea she’s an assassin sent to seduce, entrap, then ultimately destroy him.Yet Skyla herself might have the most to lose. There’s a reason Orpheus feels so familiar, a reason her body seems to crave him. Perhaps he’s not the man everyone thinks…Then again…maybe he’s exactly that man.The truth could reveal a deadly secret as old as the Eternal Guardians themselves.
