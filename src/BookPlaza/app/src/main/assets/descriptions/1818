Bound by need. Entwined in secrets…



Krystina
I had dreams and aspirations, none of which included a man by my side. Been there done that. Then I forgot my cellphone and all of my carefully laid plans went to hell. He wasn’t supposed to be there when I fell. I wasn’t supposed to get lost in a sea of sapphire blue when he helped me up. And he wasn’t supposed to be Alexander Stone, the New York billionaire real estate tycoon.I saw the dark promises in his eyes when he looked at me. But the shadows of my past haunted me, making me afraid to explore the possibilities I could never before have imagined.


Alexander
I was used to getting what I wanted. I understood the value of finesse and patience to achieve the desired result. But a chance run in with Krystina Cole quickly turned my world upside down. She was strong, determined, devastatingly beautiful—and stubborn as hell. Her quick wit and firecracker attitude was the complete opposite of what I wanted in a woman. But I still wanted to claim her. Tame her. Make her mine.And I always get what I want.
Heart of Stone is the first book in Krystina & Alexander’s epic love story. It’s the beginning of the steamy and unforgettable series by Amazon Top 100 Bestselling Author, Dakota Willink.
