Her deathbed promise to him to salvage his reputation has now brought her to Greece where she intends to prove once and for all that the fabled island is right where her father said it was. Instead, she finds a stranger floating in the sea--one whose face she's seen many times...in her dreams.AND THERE ARE DEMONS WHO PREY ON THEM.What she doesn't know is that Arik holds more than the ancient secrets that can help her find the mythical isle of Atlantis.
