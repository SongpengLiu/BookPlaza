Whether it be a ghost, hired hitter or one of his own employees, there could be no denying that something strange was definitely happening inside this house. Someone wanted her dead and had already tried to take her life once. At all costs he had to keep her alive. He had to figure this case out and fast. Not telling anyone about the suspects crossing his mind, he had decided to keep a more watchful eye on her himself. Trace realized that he was going to have to spend more time with Erin, the one person that he wanted to keep at a safe distance. He was going to have to be the professional that he had always been. After all, her safety is the number one priority for him and his team of body guards. Trace had to choke up his personal feelings and get this job done. Keeping Erin close without letting her too close. He knew that this was going to be extremely difficult for him especially since his thoughts about her hadn't been as innocent as he had let on.
