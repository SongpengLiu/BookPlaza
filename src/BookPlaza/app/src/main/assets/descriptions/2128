Heartbreaker. Playboy. Reckless. Wild and Rough. Those are just a few of the names she's called me, but I don't care as long as I get what I want - her heart.She deserves more than I can give. Problem is she's all I want. The smart thing would be to stay away. And believe me I've tried. I've kept my distance for four years...and time's up. Isabelle Stewart is mine. I've been a fighter my entire life, and I'm not afraid to fight dirty - especially for her.
