Cracks have appeared in Jack’s faith in God. Carter dies from wasting disease, David is still an alcoholic and separated from his wife and child, and Chloe vanishes. When Jack finds out that his daughter went with David to visit the Nackama tribe, he follows, intending to bring her home. Chloe wants to speak to the shaman of the Nackama tribe so that she can contact her dead twin. Along the way, her bond with her Godfather deepens, and it becomes clear that if David doesn’t stop drinking, this will be the last time he ever sees his wife and son. Jack has known for years that if David can’t stop, he’ll either drink himself to death or end his own life, unable to bear the crushing anxiety and the loss of his family. Trouble brews among the tribes and the citizens of Gredoria. Camaday is drawn into the conflict, bringing Jack, Chloe, and David face-to-face with Crown Prince Leon Stark. Jack doesn’t want innocent lives lost, David doesn’t want to lose his only chance to get his family back, and Chloe finds she has many purposes to fulfill despite being a thirteen-year-old girl.  Will the strong bond Chloe has with her Father and Godfather be enough? Can it bring a man back from the brink, help another fill the cracks in his faith, and give a little girl the strength to do what's needed? The Lion of Gredoria always gets what he wants.
