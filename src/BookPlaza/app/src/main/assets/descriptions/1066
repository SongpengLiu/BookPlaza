The sins of the father became those of the son.Wrath for taking what was precious to me.Greed for the lives that were mine to kill.Sloth for the destruction against their will.Lust for revenge and the blood I'd spill.Gluttony for the souls I craved.Envy for the spirits I had yet to take.Pride for the birthright I'd soon fulfill.One look.One moment.One girl.She was all it took for me to lose my focus.Sienna Luciano, my eighth deadly sin.It was the end of me, but not my legacy.It was only the beginning of...El Diablo's resurrection.Allow me to introduce myself.I'm Crucifixio Martinez.
