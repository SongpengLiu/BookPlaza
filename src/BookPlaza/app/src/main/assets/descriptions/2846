I've spent the last eight years working hard to put my career front and center in my life, dodging any personal complications. I have a strict no-dating policy. I've managed to piece together a reality that works for me. Eight years ago, Joel Wentworth, the love of my life, left for New York. I'd refused to go with him and I haven't seen him again. Never even spoken to him.Until now.Now, Joel's coming back to London.And I need to get over him before he gets over here.
