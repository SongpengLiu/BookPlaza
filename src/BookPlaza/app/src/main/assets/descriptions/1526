Zoe has a great pair of legs, perky boobs, and wears exactly what she needs to show it all off. She works hard for the easy sleazy you only wish you were me reputation, burying who she really is---an all-out nerd. The only time Zoe gets to be herself is when she hides under her comforter to read X-Men comics, sending jealousy stabs at everyone who attends Comic-Con.Zak's a geek to the core, shunned by everyone in school for playing Dungeons and Dragons at lunch and wearing "Use the Force" t-shirts. And Zoe's got it bad for the boy.Only Zak doesn't want Popular Zoe. He wants Geek Zoe.Praise for the How To SeriesIt made me laugh, swoon, and desperately wish for a hot nerd of my own! ---Farrah, Amazon reviewer
