Leon, having taken the Gredorian throne earlier than anticipated, learns a secret about Jack and the Peryan family from Cedric, a Baron in Gredoria. Leon, still stewing over his defeat by Jack and Chloe three years ago, has been handed the perfect reason to go to war with the man he hates. If he has his way, Jack will break and die, his family will be ripped down from the throne, and David will suffer the same fate.  Jack has a vow to keep but so does Cedric, and neither will break it. Death is the only thing that can release a man from such a promise. With two enemies, everything from Jack’s iron will to his friendship with David is tested. Not everyone gets to live and go home, and there can only be one King of Camaday. David, pushed to the brink once more, doesn’t know how he’ll get through this war. Even if he lives and goes home, he knows things will never be the same again. That’s if he doesn’t snap first. Leon simply wants his revenge, and he’s been successful in getting back at everyone that has ever crossed him. He’s helping Cedric for his own selfish reasons, but once a portion of his army threatens to fracture, he realizes there might be something else he cares about. After all, a Lion is nothing without a Lioness.
