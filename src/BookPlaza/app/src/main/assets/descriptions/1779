Librarian's Note: This is an alternate/new cover for ASIN B00JP0NWFQBOOK 2 of 4 (book 2 and 3 tell one tale) **WARNING** This Erotic novel has scenes of violence and many, many, many scenes of sex which are graphically depicted. This is not intended for young or immature readers. Mike Ripton “Ripp” is a street fighter and a boxer who doesn’t necessarily care about title fights or notoriety. He fights because he enjoys it. Beating another man excites him. Fighting bare knuckles matches for spare cash is his life. His mode of transportation is either a Harley or his 1969 Chevelle. Vivian Simone “Vee” is a ruthless Federal Attorney. As savage as she is in court, she prefers to cower at the feet of a Dominant man at night. Her only requirement is that she be in a relationship with her Dominant male counterpart. Mike Ripton doesn’t do relationships. Never has. And he believes he never will. Vee and Ripp meet by chance in a bar one afternoon while she’s at lunch. Immediately, there’s attraction from both sides… But Ripp doesn’t do relationships. Or does he? This is their story. Sexually speaking it is not for the meek of heart.
