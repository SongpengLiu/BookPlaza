My brain has been screaming at me from the inside out, warning me from the beginning that Noah is dangerous. Even still, I’ve agreed to return to the place where it all began—just for the chance to prolong my time with him.And now I have a choice to I can continue hiding as I’ve always done, or lie to the only person to know the real me in almost a decade.
