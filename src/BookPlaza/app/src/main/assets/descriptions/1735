They all made a terrible mistake. One they will pay for.For the past ten years I’ve been a victim. A victim to my pack. A victim to my true mate, who rejected me in the most brutal of ways. And a victim to Shadow Beast, who used me for his own gains.Or did he?The beast of mystery never reveals his whole hand, but one thing is for sure… in my time with him, I've changed. Now I will no longer walk the path dictated by the powerful men in my life. Never again will I let my strength be taken from me. I must evolve or die. And we all know, with a choice like that, there’s really only one answer.
