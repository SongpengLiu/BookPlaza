I work around actors but never considered getting romantically involved with one. Until I did.I’m twenty-eight years old and have been trying to find steady work as a makeup artist in L.A. I’ve been subbing on any production possible to build my portfolio in hopes of one day getting that big break into the Hollywood scene.My chance finally happened when I was called to the set of The Receiver—the sequel to a blockbuster movie. I expected to do makeup for the extras. But what I didn’t expect was to meet the lead, British heartthrob Evan Hutchinson, and do his makeup.Evan is young, handsome, and funny. Really funny. And I have to secretly admit that I like how charming and playful he is—nothing like the conceited and obnoxious actors I’m used to working around. Evan is nice. And I really enjoyed the day we spent together while I touched up his makeup.That night an unexpected call came. Evan’s agent offered me the chance to finish out the film as Evan’s personal makeup artist. I nearly dropped the phone from excitement and disbelief that my break was finally happening.But soon I’d learn of Evan’s real reason for hiring me. Then, perhaps, making it big as a makeup artist wouldn’t be my first priority…*** A Brush With Fame is a contemporary romance/new adult standalone novel. No cliffhanger. Clean language. Beta male hero. Due to sensitive subject matter (trigger warning) and moderate steam, this novel is recommended for 18+. ***
