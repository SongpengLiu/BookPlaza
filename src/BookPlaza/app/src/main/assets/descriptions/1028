“Stand and slowly turn around.” Earl Larsen gave him a faint smile. “I want to see all of you.”Ian became a prostitute to make ends meet. When he’s kicked out of the whorehouse in the middle of winter with nowhere to go and no money, Earl Isak Larsen makes an offer: Ian can live in the Castle where he’ll have food, security, and warmth. All Ian has to do is agree to be the Earl’s slave, which means cooking, cleaning, and submission.Ian already prefers men and being a submissive, so why not? If he has to get on his knees to ensure he’s fed and safe, it’s a small price to pay. He’s pretty sure Earl Larsen doesn’t think of his “Kitten” as much more than a slave, but Ian slowly starts to see the other side of him. The Earl might not show much emotion, but he’s not cruel, and he still treats his slave with more affection than anyone ever has before.Despite that, Earl Larsen has dangerous secrets hidden in his past, and someone is willing to use them even if it means hurting Ian.This is intended for mature readers only.
