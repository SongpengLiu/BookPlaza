I finally met his eyes. The grey eyes instantly gave me a feeling of ecstasy and I knew. I could imagine my unrealistic future with him, how our children run around us and he is chasing them. I could imagine my hands touching his body as he did the same, and I knew what I'd feel when I did. My mate was a monster and he would never let me go now."You're going to be their Luna. You're going to be my Luna. You will surrender and submit to me I will make sure of it," he declared, right next to my ear. "You're going to please me and carry my pups, if I have to force you to. And you will stay by my side, ruling besides me. You'll make us stronger than we already are. And most importantly, you will never, ever leave." His grip around my waist and throat tightened and I let out an uneven breath.
