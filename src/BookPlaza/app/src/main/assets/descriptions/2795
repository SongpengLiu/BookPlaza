By day, I manage The Hole Punch, and it isn't as sexy as it sounds.It's an office supply store--not an establishment for vibrators and butt plugs. By nighttime though, that's when I unleash an exciting passion of mine--one that I'm not prepared to share just yet.I don't have the time or the energy for a relationship right now. Besides, sex with colleagues is always a bad idea. Now, sex with customers? That's something I can get on board with, especially since Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome keeps showing up and setting my insides on fire. Although I don't know his name or what he does, I can only imagine what he needs with piles of paper, pens, post-its, and highlighters. Maybe one day, if I'm lucky, I can manage his hole-punch.
