One hundred and twelve years after the fall, the Republic of Texas is built on two foundations: total freedom and total responsibility. Every citizen is free to do what they like, when they like, but they must take responsibility for each action. With such an ideal to strive for, life should be good and for many, it is.

Her father is a long missing Striker with four strikes against him and a date with Justice should he ever be found.

But it’s getting harder not to fight back and earn yet another strike tattoo on her neck.Everything changes one ordinary day watching the latest catch of smugglers and Strikers being returned for justice. Within their ranks is the father Karas can’t even remember. And he has a message.
