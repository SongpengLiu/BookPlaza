Samantha Jellicoe is enjoying her new legitimate career and her romance with billionaire Richard Addison. Of course, this doesn't mean she's gotten over the urge to steal, but she's been able to fight it off––most of the time. Then she spies someone she never thought she'd see again ––her father, Martin Jellicoe. Sam thought Martin had died in prison years before, but now that he's back, she knows he's up to no good. Her worst fears come true when a new painting that Rick purchased goes missing. Sam knows her father is behind it, but with the police focused on her checkered past, this won't be easy to prove. Between keeping her father's return a secret, searching for the missing art, and saving their reputations, Rick and Samantha's relationship will be tested like never before.
