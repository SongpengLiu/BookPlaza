Ell is on pins and needles waiting for Helga to return with the blade they need to kill King Tobin, and while she waits, a little sex with a quick raining montage is in order. Ell is living it up, but when Helga returns, being vague as ever, Ell and her boys find out they have no choice but to go into the lion's den. They'll need to trek across Fay, hide out in the UnSeelie capital, and then figure out a way to get close to the King. All they have to do is use the blade Helga provided, and all will be well. Sounds easy, right? Wrong. Of course, it wouldn't be Ell's story without some shenanigans and side of drama thrown in for good measure.This is the last chapter in A Fairy Awesome Series where Ell will finally face off with King Tobin. Maybe more than once. In the end though, Ell gets the surprise of her life, and everything they've planned for may need to be thrown out the window.A Fairy Awesome Series is a medium-burn, fantasy reverse-harem, where Ell collects Men/Fairies as the series progresses.
