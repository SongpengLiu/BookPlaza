Archer Dean taught me how it feels to be loved. Really loved. The happily ever after, fairy tale type love. But he also taught me what real heartbreak was. He ripped away my happiness, took it from me without a backward glance. He left me alone and broken with no idea how to rebuild. No fight left in me to want to.  Annabelle Edwards was a light in my world of darkness. She changed the way my heart beat, she let me believe in love. But the thing about darkness is that itâ€™s suffocating and without warning, the light that you rely so heavily on, can be extinguished by the power of your own shadows.
