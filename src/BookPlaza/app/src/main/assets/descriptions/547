By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride. When he encounters Jamie, the feisty and beautiful daughter of Baron Jamison, he immediately selects her, determined to touch, tame, and possess her forever. But Jamie has vowed to never surrender to this fierce highland barbarian. He is everything she had been warned against—an arrogant scoundrel whose rough good looks hint at savage pleasures. And though his scorching kisses fire her blood, she brazenly resists him…until one rapturous moment quells their clash of wills, and something far more dangerous than desire threatens to conquer her completely.
