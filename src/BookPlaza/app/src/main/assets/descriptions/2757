What do you see when you look to the stars? The thing about the universe is that nothing is ever the same. It grows exponentially, it disappears into the dark abyss, it creates entire galaxies out of nothing and just as quick, it can destroy it all. It’s beautiful, and it’s always changing. The thing about high school senior Ricky Schenk’s life is…well, absolutely nothing is changing. He has been stuck in the same boring routine. Wake up, excel at school, lead extracurricular clubs, get unbelievably blackout drunk, go to bed. The usual. It used to be easy to ignore – the black hole in his chest that is – but the voices are getting too loud. And they won’t wait any longer. Meet Hana, the complete opposite of Ricky. She keeps her head down in class with her nervous fingers pulling at the ends of the sweater. After Ricky snoops in her academic file, she quickly becomes the object of his fascination. For lack of non-cliché terms, she’s different. It’s a long shot, but if Hana could help him out of his rut, maybe he could make it through the rest of the school year.Maybe she can even help him reach the stars.
