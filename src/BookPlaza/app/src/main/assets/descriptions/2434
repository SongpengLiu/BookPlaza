The king of the Court of Love wants me dead, the queen wants me in her bed, and the prince… He wants the only piece of me I will never surrender.They call me jester, dancer, trickster, lover.I exist to entertain.But behind my sideways smiles, my quick hands and magicians tricks, I trade in their lies, their secrets. I know their deepest desires, their wicked schemes. Their sins are my currency.The Court of Love is a card castle, and I hold the card that’s about to bring it all down.And they say I’m the fool…*Fool Me Once is a dark MM fantasy brimming with courtly spice, morally ambiguous anti-heroes, and a fool who plays them all.This is a dark world with adult content.
