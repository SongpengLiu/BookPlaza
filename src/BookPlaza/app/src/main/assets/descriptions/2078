A clean slate. People pray for one on occasion, some desperate individuals go to drastic measures to achieve one. I wasn’t given the choice. I woke up in a foreign country alone, afraid and with no idea who I am.I was lucky though. The reigning monarch of Cynthera and his family took me in, nursed me back to health. There’s one problem, the Crown Prince, Emory Bryn. He’s not what one would expect and the last thing I should be getting involved with. He has priorities too, his own restrictions. I’m off limits. No exceptions, no alternatives.Trying to discover my identity and navigate my new life is exhausting enough without adding a torrid love affair into the mix. He’s a Prince and I, well; I’m a conflict of interest. Fighting our nature, choosing our duties over our desires and things turn hostile in a hurry.When memories of my previous life start to reveal themselves I’m torn between two worlds. The one I’ve created and come to love and the one filled with questions and hints of something terrifying. How do I keep my new family and return to the family of my birth?There’s something dark buried deep in my mind, something I don’t know if I can face. A darkness that threatens both my lives. Now I have a choice and it’s one I never wanted to make.
