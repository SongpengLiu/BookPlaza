“I learned a long time ago that I can’t fully trust anyone,” Earl Larsen said quietly.Ian knows he should simply walk away and leave everything behind. If the Earl won’t do anything to help himself, what can Ian do? He can’t fight, he’s not rich, and he has no connections. The Earl won’t directly admit or deny the accusations made against him.After Ian learns something from an unexpected source, doubt and guilt fuel him. There’s no denying that he was used, but at the same time, the Earl treated him like a treasured pet. He refused to go through with a prior agreement and risked his own safety instead of Ian.If Earl Larsen is actually innocent and the victim of a greedy man, how can Ian go away? He allowed his lack of trust to get in the way at first, but now he’ll have to make a leap of faith and find a way to get to the truth even if it means going to Relluck.If his plan fails, Ian might find himself in an escapable situation at the hands of monsters who will gladly hurt him if it means keeping the Earl compliant.
