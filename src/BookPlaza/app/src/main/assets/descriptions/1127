What if she isn't what he believes he wants so badly?Come on Travis and Violet's journey of love, heartache and all the things in between.This book is erotica; it contains graphic sexual content and swearing - it is lusty, crazy, beautiful and in parts morally incorrect. It is one hell of a rollercoaster ride of love and heartache. It is action packed with drama, if this is not your thing, please don't purchase it. It does end with a cliff hanger but I promise the next book will be HEA! Please remember it is FICTION!!!
