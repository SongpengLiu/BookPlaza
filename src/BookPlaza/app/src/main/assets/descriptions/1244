Oriel Keeper is the Crown Prince of West Bay, but even he’s supposed to follow his Father’s rules. He’s tired of only being allowed out with a guard pasted to his side even though his eighteenth birthday is so close. Maybe the homeless guy he spotted can help him out.When he starts to get new feelings that he’s never experienced with anyone else, he knows Aspen is the one for him. If Oriel has too, he’ll marry Aspen even without his Father’s blessing.Aspen’s time is money, and he’s sure the Crown Prince wouldn’t even look twice at him. It’s clear what his profession is, but when Oriel offers to pay him for fun on the beach, and nothing else, how can he say no?People like him don’t get happy endings with royalty, and while he reciprocates every touch and kiss with all of his heart, he knows it won’t last. He’s heading straight for a bruised heart, but he can’t stop. When he receives an offer from the King, he takes it, thinking he can have a little more time with the Crown Prince. A little is better than nothing, and he’s used to settling for far less.If only he’d believed Oriel.If only Oriel hadn’t been foolish enough to give his heart away.
