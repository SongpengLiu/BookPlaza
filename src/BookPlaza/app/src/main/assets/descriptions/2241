But when she visits Virgin River, she runs into Luke Riordan, decidedly not whom she has in mind.A handsome Black Hawk pilot, Luke exited the army after twenty years, four wars and having been shot out of the sky three times. At thirty-eight, he’s tough and jaded. His major was in one-night stands, with a minor in commitment avoidance.Technically, these two are all wrong for one another. But sometimes what you want and what you need are two different things…two very good things.Don't miss Robyn Carr's next uplifting novel, The Friendship Club, where four women come together at a tumultuous time in their lives, forging an unbreakable bond that will leave them all forever changed—available January 2024!Virgin River
