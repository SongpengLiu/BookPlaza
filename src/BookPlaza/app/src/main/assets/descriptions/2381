You know that squirmy sensation in your gut when you have no idea what you're doing and you're about to screw everything up?Yeah, that feeling.I thought I was a good judge of character, but recent events proved me very wrong.

The squirmy feeling is making sense, right?Unfortunately, I don't have any other options. Ezra's time is almost up, which means I need answers and I need them fast.
