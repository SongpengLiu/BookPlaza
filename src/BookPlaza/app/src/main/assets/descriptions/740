His name is Klive King and my insides flip-flop every time we meet. I sense something is ... amiss, that he's keeping secrets, but like a mortal fool drawn to a vampire, I cannot fight the pull of Klive's mysterious danger. But Jase is hiding something, too, and I'm beginning to wonder if I have a thing for dangerous men. Who is the better bad decision?****I should leave Kinsley to Jase. He loves her. She'd never love me if she learned my true identity. Nightshade ordered me to sever all ties to her, however, the further I push her away, the more tempted I am to violate their deadly command and throw us both into peril that forces us together.
