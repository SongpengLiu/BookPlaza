It is 1988 and the band Bushmaster is on its 4th album and 2nd US tour. The front man, Vince Slaughter, is electrocuted on stage at the sound check. Everyone had a motive, but the keyboard player Hamish MacGrough is especially concerned as his wife may have had an affair with Slaughter. Was she involved, can they get home to Scotland before their window of opportunity to do a singles album closes? Hamish's search takes him up and down the western coast from Los Angeles to Washington state. Through it all his main concern is keeping his wife out of the running as a prime suspect.
