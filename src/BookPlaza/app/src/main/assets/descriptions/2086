Ever since Theo got infected with the vampire dust, the symptoms of a vampire have taken over her, so she was sent to the Prison of Deviants - a secluded fortress in a remote part of the world, created to keep deviants (humanoid creatures with different blood and superior powers) away from humanity.Theo tries to keep herself aloof since, as a newly-infected human, she hates deviants, but this attitude doesn't last long: young deviant men are very interested in getting their hands on the newcomer. Derek, a merman, invites her to parties; and Shon, a newly-turned werewolf, becomes her close friend. It grows even more complicated with the appearance of Knut - a mysterious feline hunk whose identity and powers are not quite clear, but who manages to attract Theo with his complex personality.Theo, aware that the inborn deviants will never look at them - the infected humans - as equals, decides to break out of the prison along with her friends. But for that, she'll have to challenge the mysterious and omnipotent warden, whom few have seen, yet all are terrified of.
