The old myths from centuries ago had some things right about Loki: He was bisexual, gender fluid, a trickster, and he did both good and bad things. But the tales made by humans don’t contain everything that happened, and many were warped over time.Loki has spent his centuries playing tricks, traveling, and sleeping with whoever he wants with little regard for consequences. His wife has already left him for his inability to keep it in his trousers, so why not continue doing what he wants? The life of a human is short, and he never allows himself to get close. They’re amusement, release, and something to play and interact with when he’s not in Asgard. To get close would mean to lose them, and the trickster prefers happiness, not grief.A terrible mistake leaves a smear on his past, and the results could be dangerous in the future. But the trickster never learns, and after a fatal prank in Asgard, he must either run and live his life in hiding or pay a price to stay alive and keep his children safe.Can he be so unselfish for a task that will last for centuries and require the very thing he’s sworn not to do? Can he put himself through grief and loss over and over?It’s a steep price, but others have paid dearly for his trickery and selfishness.
