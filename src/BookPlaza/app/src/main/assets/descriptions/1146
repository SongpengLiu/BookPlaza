He’s everything that Esai has tried to forget and push away, but even the pain he forces himself to endure as punishment isn’t enough to rid him of his sinful thoughts.When Tiras’s true form becomes evident, and he offers a new way, will Esai turn away or run right toward temptation?While this novella contains a completely different pairing, it is related to the Fallen series which would probably be helpful to understand the Fallen realm.
