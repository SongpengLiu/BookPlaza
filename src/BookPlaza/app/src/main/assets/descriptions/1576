He never found a girl that didn’t immediately fall head over heels, and straight into his bed–until her. Nate Peters is living the playboy life. He has great friends; a great job; no responsibilities; and best of all, no girlfriend to complicate things. Being incredibly skilled with a pick-up line, he’s never failed to get a girl in his life… until he meets Rosie. Unable to stand a dented ego, Nate makes it his mission to win over this off-limits brunette, but it proves for one wild ride as Rosie has surprises of her own that rock Nate to the core. Has the player finally been played? Note: This is a companion novel of Nothing Left to Lose; however, this is a standalone novel and there is no requirement to read Nothing Left to Lose (parts 1 and 2) first.
