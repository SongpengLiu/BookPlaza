Untainted is the gripping ending to a unique story—can Derrick and Annie save Kate before it’s too late? The infamous serial killer, The Photographer, is gone, but this time he’s taken a prisoner with him. The police are closing in, but always two steps behind. Someone is dead. Someone is missing. Kate Jackson is one of those two. Derrick Kane finds himself teaming up with Annie, Kate’s younger sister in a desperate search for answers. Every dirty secret from the past comes to light, and they are faced with the ultimate test of true love…and true heartbreak. When an innocent life is on the line, the cost of justice could be more than love can afford. Not everyone makes it to the end of their love story. Trigger Warning: Due to violent and dark subject matter, this book is intended for 18+ years old. This book does contain triggers for violence and abuse.
