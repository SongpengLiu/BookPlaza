Dr. Ivan Rusilko has got it bad. He’s in love—with life, his work, and his baby girl, Jaden Thorne. The nearly 3000 miles between Miami and L.A. that once threatened their happily-ever-after now seem nothing more than a mere geographical challenge—nothing a few hours on a plane and a sexy weekend rendezvous can’t trump. No time apart is too long to keep him from wanting her in his arms and in his bed. He’s absolutely sure Jaden is his dream come true. Jaden Thorne is living the life she’s always wanted. She’s got her one-in-a-million job on a TV cooking show, she’s achieved celebrity chef status, and she’s in a committed relationship with her perfect guy… Then the network’s surprise decision to add a co-host to her show takes a bite out of her perfectly balanced life and career. With a new man in the mix, living the dream gets a whole lot more complicated both personally and professionally. When the emotional, mental, and physical paths of true love’s course collide with frustration, secrets, and assumptions, will Ivan and Jaden pay the price? Does their dream-come-true cost something neither can afford? The Winemaker’s Dinner: Entrée is a decadent meal of passion, sex, and secrets, inspired by the real romantic life of Dr. Ivan Rusilko. Authors Everly Drummond and Dr. Ivan Rusilko have turned up the heat in this emotional follow up to The Winemaker’s Dinner: Appetizers, expertly executing their unique recipe for blending fact and fantasy, with more than a dash of passion and sex.
