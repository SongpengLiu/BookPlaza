Jack and his two sisters, Fiona and Amelia, have watched their older brother, Jacknell, grow from a young King placed on the throne too early to a cruel man who rules Camaday through fear. Fiona, beset by anxiety, is only seen as a pawn for Jacknell to create an alliance with Gredoria or Emaray. Charlotte, who ends up at the Castle after escaping a brothel she was sold to, befriends Fiona. Jack, used to going from one woman to the next, realizes Charlotte isn’t one he can just bed and move on. But for the first time, he wants more with a woman.  When war with Emaray starts, Jack has to leave his sister and the first woman he has true affection for. Jacknell’s cruelty grows, leading to the death of his citizens. For the first time, Jack begins to think that the kingdom would be better off without his brother ruling it.  But the only way is if Jacknel dies. Jack’s choices could cost him everything, even his life, or it could lead to the salvation of the kingdom, and the people he loves most. Fiona and Charlotte have to find strength they didn’t know they had in them to guide their own. Without all three of them, Camaday could end up with a King worse than Jacknell.
